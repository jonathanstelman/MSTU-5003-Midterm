## Topic
Ukulele as a "serious" musical instrument: making the path to higher musicianship fun and inclusive.

## Problem
In music education, certain instruments are treated as more or less "valid" than others. Orchestral and symphonic instruments are treated more seriously by music schools, musicians, and by the public at large. As a result, learners who enter into musical studies through less "serious" instruments, such as guitar, drums, keyboards, and ukulele, can be made to feel inferior in a number of ways.

The ukulele presents a particularly good opportunity, as it has become very popular over a very short time span. Many instrument manufacturers jumped on this opportunity, and several companies are engaged in a war to produce the cheapest ukulele possible. When instruments are priced so low, it is natural to treat it as a toy. Not everyone who buys a $30 instrument intends to invest in expensive music lessons or time-consuming music programs at school.

Without useful resources, learners tend to learn a few chords, get bored, and move on to the next thing. Instead, we hope that learners of ukulele can discover a place where their “toy” ukulele is treated as a real instrument, so that these players can stay on a path of musical fulfillment for years to come.

## Target Audience
The target audience consists of beginner to intermediate players of the ukulele who want to learn ukulele *and music* together. The tone is somewhat academic, in that it does not shy away from talking about music with a more sophisticated vocabulary, so the reading ability of users should be at least the 8th grade level. The site is also designed to meet the needs of more experienced musicians, who are interested in deepening their knowledge of music theory and history - possibly in preparation for enrollment in music school.

### User Stories
**Outline 2-3 user stories. Describe how they find out, engage and come back to your site. Provide rationale.**

Structure your user stories as features, so you can actually build it to meet the users needs.

**Example**: As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].

Keep these questions in mind:
	* Who are you building the feature for? What type of user?
	* What are you building and what will it accomplish?
	* What kind of engagement and value will the feature/website bring for the user?
	* What does it accomplish?

## Strategy
### Site Objectives:
We want to create and foster a community of engaged ukulele players who will support each other through their continuing journey to advanced musicianship.

### Success Metrics:
The paid version of the site will be the focal point of our strategy and success metrics. We will look to regular site visits, advancement through curriculum, and posts in forums as the primary  measures of success.

Make sure your program does something to measure the consider assessments as a part of your program. Here are a couple.

* Pre assessments
* Formative assessments
