## Topic
Ukulele as a "serious" musical instrument: Making the path to higher musicianship inclusive and fun.

## Problem
In music education, certain instruments are treated as more or less "valid" than others. Orchestral and symphonic instruments are treated more seriously by music schools, musicians, and by the public at large. As a result, learners who enter into musical studies through less "serious" instruments, such as guitar, drums, keyboards, and ukulele, can be made to feel inferior in a number of ways.

The ukulele presents a particularly good opportunity, as it has become very popular over a very short time span. Many instrument manufacturers jumped on this opportunity, and several companies are engaged in a war to produce the cheapest ukulele possible. When instruments are priced so low, it is natural to treat it as a toy. Not everyone who buys a $30 instrument intends to invest in expensive music lessons or time-consuming music programs at school.

Without useful resources, learners tend to learn a few chords, get bored, and move on to the next thing. Instead, we hope that learners of ukulele can discover a place where their “toy” ukulele is treated as a real instrument, so that these players can stay on a path of musical fulfillment for years to come.

## Target Audience
The target audience consists of beginner to intermediate players of the ukulele who want to learn ukulele *and music* together. The tone is somewhat academic, in that it does not shy away from talking about music with a more sophisticated vocabulary, so the reading ability of users should be at least the 8th grade level. The site is also designed to meet the needs of more experienced musicians, who are interested in deepening their knowledge of music theory and history - possibly in preparation for enrollment in music school.

### User Stories
#### User Story 1: Sarah, 10th Grader, interested in applying to music school.
Sarah is a 10th grader who is active in her school’s chorus and theater program, and wants to take her interest in music to the next level by learning an instrument. She bought a beginner’s ukulele, and taught herself how to play a few Beatles songs by watching videos on YouTube. Still, she doesn’t think of herself a real musician, since note names and sheet music seem like a foreign language to her. Sarah wants to apply to a theater arts program next year, but fears that, if she is going to pass any music entrance exam, she will have to learn to play a new instrument like piano, and she just can’t afford that.

Sarah then stumbled upon our website, and saw that music theory can be learned with only a ukulele. After browsing through all of the basic lessons, she decided to become a Premium member, and was assigned a track that will teach her everything she needs to know to convince schools she is serious about her musicianship. Sarah also met other people on the forums who have recently been accepted to music schools, and have offered her advice for how to prepare for the auditions.

#### User Story 2: Jon, experienced musician, interested in learning advanced improvisation techniques on a new instrument
Jon is an experienced musician who studied guitar in college. He received a ukulele for Christmas, and is seeking resources that can help him build up his repertoire on the ukulele, and can prepare him for collaborative rock / folk projects, where will improvise chord / melody accompaniment. He has visited a number of ukulele websites, but, by and large, they don’t at all seem interested in talking about music in musical terms.

Jon wants to be able to find resources that talk about scale patterns and how to utilize the unordered string structure of the instrument as an advantage. Furthermore, he wants to connect with advanced ukulele players and find out who their influences are, and how they are experimenting with the instrument.

## Strategy
### Site Objectives:
We want to create and foster a community of engaged ukulele players who will support each other through their continuing journey to advanced musicianship.

### Success Metrics:
The paid version of the site will be the focal point of our strategy and success metrics. We will look to regular site visits, advancement through curriculum, and posts in forums as the primary  measures of success.

Make sure your program does something to measure the consider assessments as a part of your program. Here are a couple.

* Pre assessments
* Formative assessments
